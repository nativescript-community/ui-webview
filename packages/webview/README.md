# @nativescript-community/ui-webview

Extended WebView for NativeScript which adds many options.
The code is originally based on [nativescript-webview-ext](https://github.com/m-abs/nativescript-webview-ext)

## Features
* Adds a custom-scheme handler for x-local:// to the webview for loading of resources inside the webview.
    * Note: For iOS 11+ WKWebView is used, but for iOS <11 UIWebView is used
* Adds support for capturing URLs.
    *  This allows the app to open external links in an external browser and handle tel-links
* Added functions like:
    - `executeJavaScript(code: string)` for executing JavaScript-code and getting result.
    - `executePromise(code: string)` for calling promises and getting the result.
    - `getTitle()` returns document.title.
* Adds functions to inject `css`- and `javascript`-files.
    * Into the current page.
    * Auto-injected on page load.

* Supports:
    * Android 19+
    * iOS 9+

## Installation

Describe your plugin installation steps. Ideally it would be something like:

```bash
tns plugin add @nativescript-community/ui-webview
```

### Angular support

Import `AWebViewModule` from `@nativescript-community/ui-webview/angular` and add it to your `NgModule`.

This registers the element `AWebView`. Replace the <WebView> tag with <AWebView>

### Vue support

```js
import Vue from 'nativescript-vue';
import WebViewPlugin from '@nativescript-community/ui-webview/vue';

Vue.use(WebViewPlugin);
```
This registers the element `AWebView`. Replace the <WebView> tag with <AWebView>


## Usage

## Limitations

In order to intercept requests for the custom scheme, we use `UIWebView` for iOS 9 and 10 and `WKWebView` for iOS 11+.

iOS 11 added support for setting a `WKURLSchemeHandler` on the `WKWebView`.
Prior to iOS 11 there isn't support for intercepting the URL with `WKWebView`, so we use a custom `NSURLProtocol` + `UIWebView`.

### Important:
The custom `NSURLProtocol` used with UIWebView is shared with all instances of the AWebView, so mapping `x-local://local-filename.js` => `file://app/full/path/local-filename.js` is shared between them.

| supportPopups | true / false | iOS: should the webview support popup windows (window.open, target="_blank"). Defaults to true |
| scrollBarIndicatorVisible | false | Allow to hide scrollbars. |

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| loadUrl(src: string): Promise<LoadFinishedEventData> | Open a URL and resolves a promise once it has finished loading. |
| registerLocalResource(resourceName: string, path: string): void; | Map the "x-local://{resourceName}" => "{path}". |
| unregisterLocalResource(resourceName: string): void; | Removes the mapping from "x-local://{resourceName}" => "{path}" |
| getRegisteredLocalResource(resourceName: string): void; | Get the mapping from "x-local://{resourceName}" => "{path}" |
| loadJavaScriptFile(scriptName: string, filepath: string) | Inject a javascript-file into the webview. Should be called after the `loadFinishedEvent` |
| loadStyleSheetFile(stylesheetName: string, filepath: string, insertBefore: boolean) | Loads a CSS-file into document.head. If before is true, it will be added to the top of document.head otherwise as the last element |
| loadJavaScriptFiles(files: {resourceName: string, filepath: string}[]) | Inject multiple javascript-files into the webview. Should be called after the `loadFinishedEvent` |
| loadStyleSheetFiles(files: {resourceName: string, filepath: string, insertBefore: boolean}[]) | Loads multiple CSS-files into the document.head. If before is true, it will be added to the top of document.head otherwise as the last element |
| autoLoadJavaScriptFile(resourceName: string, filepath: string) | Register a JavaScript-file to be injected on `loadFinishedEvent`. If a page is already loaded, the script will be injected into the current page. |
| autoLoadStyleSheetFile(resourceName: string, filepath: string, insertBefore?: boolean) | Register a CSS-file to be injected on `loadFinishedEvent`. If a page is already loaded, the CSS-file will be injected into the current page. |
| autoExecuteJavaScript(scriptCode: string, name: string) | Execute a script on `loadFinishedEvent`. The script can be a promise |

## Events

| loadStarted | Raised when a loadStarted event occurs. args is a `LoadStartedEventData` |
| shouldOverrideUrlLoading | Raised before the webview requests an URL. Can cancelled by setting args.cancel = true in the `ShouldOverrideUrlLoadEventData` |
| titleChanged | Document title changed |
| webAlert | Raised when `window.alert` is triggered inside the webview, needed to use customs dialogs for web alerts. args in a `WebAlertEventData`. `args.callback()` must be called to indicate alert is closed. **NOTE:** Not supported by UIWebView |
| webConfirm | Raised when `window.confirm` is triggered inside the webview, needed to use customs dialogs for web confirm boxes. args in a `webConfirmEvent`. `args.callback(boolean)` must be called to indicate confirm box is closed. **NOTE:** Not supported by UIWebView |
| webConsole | Android only: Raised when a line is added to the web console. args is a `WebConsoleEventData`. |

| Events emitted from the webview | Raised when nsWebViewBridge.emit(...) is called inside the webview. args in an `WebViewEventData` |

### WebView

Inside the WebView we have the `nsWebViewBridge` for sending events between the `NativeScript`-layer and the `WebView`.
**Note:** The bridge will only be available `DOMContentLoaded` or `onload` inside the WebView.

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| window.nsWebViewBridge.on(eventName: string, cb: (data: any) => void) | Registers handlers for events from the native layer. |
| window.nsWebViewBridge.off(eventName: string, cb?: (data: any) => void) | Unregister handlers for events from the native layer. |
| window.nsWebViewBridge.emit(eventName: string, data: any) | Emits event to NativeScript layer. Will be emitted on the AWebView as any other event, data will be a part of the WebViewEventData-object |
